## Project Overview

This project aims to address the challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for data preprocessing in highly specialized domains. LLMs often require substantial computational resources and may generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical. Our solutions focus on improving efficiency, accuracy, and scalability through various strategies.

## Features

- **Domain-Specific Pretrained Models**: Fine-tune LLMs on domain-specific datasets to leverage transfer learning and create specialized smaller models.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Incorporate domain experts for validation and interactive refinement of LLM outputs.
- **Fact-Checking Mechanisms**: Use external knowledge bases and post-processing validation to ensure the accuracy of generated text.
- **Resource Optimization Techniques**: Employ efficient model architectures and distributed computing for better resource management.
- **Selective LLM Usage**: Apply LLMs contextually and combine them with traditional methods and simpler models.
- **Customized Prompt Engineering**: Develop and refine domain-specific prompts to guide LLM outputs effectively.
